A tutoring management tool web application for simplifying private tuition.
This is a React web app that interfaces with a Flask API for managing information about clients.
It enables tutoring sessions to be scheduled and synced to the user's and client's Google Calendar.
Emails can be sent to clients containing an automatically generated Google Meet Link so that they may join an online call at the appropriate time.
Emails can also be sent after a session to ask how the client thought the session went and provide an opportunity to let them know of any further details.

To ensure the endpoints of the Flask API behave correctly, Pytest is used.
